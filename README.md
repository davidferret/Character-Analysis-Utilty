# Character Analysis

This program analyzes individual characters or entire strings to determine their types and composition. You can use it to analyze a single character or an entire string to identify the different character types and their frequencies.

For a single character, the program identifies whether it's a vowel, consonant, digit, or special symbol. It also provides an analysis of the composition of a string, counting the number of vowels, consonants, digits, and special characters.

The program uses built-in character functions for efficient analysis and makes the process easy for you. It accepts both single characters and full strings as input, ensuring that you can perform your analysis no matter the size or format of the input.

## Example Output
```
Enter a single character or a string: hello123!
